**`Digital Craftsman`**

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹...
...I'm a mechanical engineer transitioning into the world of software development. My background in engineering has given me string foundation in problem-solving, logical thinking, precision, and planning, which I now apply to coding. I'm passioante about full-stack web development and software engineering, building projects from scratch to solve real-world problems.

ðŸ’¡ Let's build something!
