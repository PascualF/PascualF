**`Digital Craftsman`**

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹...
...I'm a mechanical engineer transitioning into the world of software development. My background in engineering has given me string foundation in problem-solving, logical thinking, precision, and planning, which I now apply to coding. I'm passionate about full-stack web development and software engineering, building projects from scratch to solve real-world problems.

ðŸ’¡ Let's build something!

  <summary><h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
    I started to code during my mechanical engineering course, it all started with some basic VBA, for simulations, jumping fast to python, I saw that I was quite good at it, but did continue with my journey as a mechanical engineer, ended up working as a mechanical design engineer, mixing calculation, design and creativity.
