**`Digital Craftsman`**

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹...
...I'm a mechanical engineer with a hobby in the world of software development. My background in engineering gives me strong foundation in problem-solving, logical thinking, precision, and planning, which I now apply to coding. I'm passionate about software engineering, building projects from scratch to solve real-world problems.

ðŸ’¡ Let's build something!

<details>
  <summary><h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
    I started coding during my mechanical engineering course. It all began with some basic VBA for simulations, and then I quickly transitioned to Python. I realized I was quite good at it. Still, I did continue with my journey as a mechanical engineer, ended up working as a mechanical design engineer, mixing calculation, design and creativity.
